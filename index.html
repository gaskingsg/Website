	<h3>Personal Information</h3>


	<p>Hello my name is Scott Gaskin</p>
	<p><strong>Student ID:</strong> S3799302</p>
	<p><strong>Student Email:</strong> S3799302@student.rmit.edu.au</p>


	<p>Small bit of background on me. I immigrated to Australia 8 years ago. Managed to get around quite a bit and use to live in a camper van.
	Finally, have settled in Melbourne and have running water again. </p>


	<p> I am currently studying Bachelor of Business @ Rmit via Open Uni. This is my 8th unit.
	Wish I could speak another language, if I could choose one it to wake up and be able to speak it would be Japanese.


	<p>Favourite sport is Football (or as Aussies call it Soccer) this has be up at all hours of the night to watch EPL games in the UK.
	Interested in IT to broaden my current skills base and will be doing all 5 of my elective units in IT. My interest comes from a want to learn how to code to help optimize business processes.


	<p> Always have had a keen interest but did not have the exposure growing up to develop my skills. </p>


	<p>I choose this program to get a start and see if I can get a greater understanding and some extra skills. </p>
	<p>I attended a IOT meeting on how the IOT can be used to track waste levels inside bins reducing wasted transport costs and I was hooked in.</p>

	<h3>My Ideal Job</h3>
		
	<p> My ideal job would be to lead a national company as the Head of Supply Chain. To get to this role,
	  It will take me finishing my degree and having a few years of experience in this field.
	  Currently I work as a Transport Solution Designer and feel this is a good building block to progress
	  further on my career path. </P>


	  <p> As the head of Supply chain, I would have full control of the end-to-end process of landing goods
	    in the most efficient and most cost-efficient way. To be successful it would require a high attention
	    to detail and amazing depth of knowledge of Supply Chains. </P>


	<p>It also require a strong commercial background to ensure profitability. I am currently developing these
	  required skills in my current role and look forward to expanding these vital skills in the coming years. </P>


	<h3> Personal Profile Myers-Briggs Test </h3>

	<p> The results of my MBTI have indicated that I am a ESTJ - The Coordinators. I feel these test
	results are an accurate representation of my personality. </p>


	<p> I feel these results will assist with forming a strong team, with a focus on teamwork and collaboration.
	Our team has been formed since Week 1 and have been in regular communication to start the ball rolling on out
	team project. </p>


	<p> Taking into account the results, it will be key to good communication, with a open two way dialog between all
	  team members to have successful outcomes. The results describe me very well, but as I do not have a background
	in IT or Coding, I will be taking the lead from another team member on how we can progress. Also, will be happy
	to share responsibility on leading meetings and keeping track of projects.  </p>


<h3>Project overview</h3>

<p>Welcome to the overview of my first RMIT into to IT project. I aim to provide you a detailed overview on a project idea within the IT industry that will lay the foundation for a team to build this project in the coming few months. Just a bit of background, this project is industry based as it work within Transport and Logistics and see this as a issue every day with our customer service team. I look forward to your feedback at the end of this assignment and hope you have enjoyed the content contained within my website.  </p>
<p>The project I am proposing is a parcel tracking chat bot. The chat bot built into a website, would be able to check the location of any parcel traveling across Australia. </p>
<p>One central location to check on the status of a parcel no matter the carrier. This would save a company having to check with multiple providers of transport on parcel status. To start it is proposed to select 3 major E-coms carriers in Australia Auspost, Toll & TNT, with the view of expanding to a wider carrier pool if successful. It would be a paid service that could close out parcel movements within the internal business systems leading to saved time & productivity. </p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>
		  
<p> Time is the main motivation the explosion of e-coms in Australia in the past 12 months. YTD 934 million parcels have been delivered in Australia (Pitney Bowes, 2020).
 The main aim to create this centralize a chat portal to check the status of a parcel, letter, or package. The function would be built into a website & give business a single point of reference for parcel deliveries. The result would be saving of hours of work for people having to reference multiple websites to get milestone reports. </p>

<h3>Description</h3>
		  
<p>A chat portal that would allow a user to enter a tracking ID from any major carrier in Australia and get a result of the transit status. The Chat Bot would remember the customers email, phone number & tracking number to send milestone alerts, for example that the parcel you have ordered from Amazon has been scanned as picked-up from the Fulfilment centre, the parcel has passed Via the carrier’s sortation centre, parcel is in transit with an estimated delivery date, out for delivery alert, live tracking if offered by the carrier and finally a delivery confirmation. </p>
<p>This would be aimed at a business user that selects multiple third-party delivery providers such as Auspost, Toll Express & TNT. A single point to enter a consignment number to then get alerts fed back to a central dashboard for your business. No more chasing down each carrier for status updates. The aim of this product would be to increase productivity within a business and assist a customer service function in getting greater results for an end customer. </p>
<p>The overall aim would be to link this system to the business system that would give greater visibility of each parcel status. As an end-to-end process once the parcel is delivered, the chat bot would be able to send a notification to the business system and close out this job as completed. It would also notify the customer of the proof of delivery. I am sure we have all had to chase down a photo of where a parcel has been left in the last 12 months, this bot would have all of that details stored so if asked for a parcel to be tracked and it has been left somewhere safe it would then send you the link to te photo of the parcel in a safe place. </p>
<p>It would also enable customers to compare carrier’s performance, enabling them to make smarter business decision around who is best carrier to send parcels with to a certain geographical location or who was the largest / smallest spend over the past 12 months. The aim would be to give a single point of visibility for tracking, cost management and performance. </p>


<h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
<p>A HTLM Website that would be easy to navigate with a great user experience, with a chat bot to assist with the entry of the consignment number. A git hub page to share all relevant coding with the team to complete this project. An API to link to all relevant carriers for tracking and tracking of parcels, this link is free and available on the developer end of the carrier’s websites. </p>
<p> A server would be required to host this Website. I feel the skills would be feasible to complete this project, with a good hard-working team willing to learn new process of coding & website design. It would also give us a chance to learn how to Link website APIs for things such as address validation using the google maps API. </p>

<h3>Outcome</h3>
		  
<p>Streamlined approach to tracking and tracking parcels for business users. Saving countless hours on the phone chasing up third-party carriers. The problem will be solved when the project has been fully implemented and has been tested to its full capabilities. Development will have a direct business impact bottom line in savings of hours on the phone and a major labour saving. It will also have a social impact resulting in less interaction between customer service departments at major business. </p>
<p>To generate revenue, we could have adds and a paid version with an annual subscription cost. At first, we would target small to medium enterprise’s that operate sole online as they would spend a lot of time chasing down different items. Any saving to a small business Is critical to their success.  </p>
