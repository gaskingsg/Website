<h3>Personal Information</h3>

<p>Hello my name is Scott Gaskin</p>
<p><strong>Student ID:</strong> S3799302</p>
<p><strong>Student Email:</strong> S3799302@student.rmit.edu.au</p>

<p>Small bit of background on me. I immigrated to Australia 8 years ago. Managed to get around quite a bit and use to live in a camper van.
Finally, have settled in Melbourne and have running water again.</p>

<p> I am currently studying Bachelor of Business @ Rmit via Open Uni. This is my 8th unit.
Wish I could speak another language, if I could choose one it to wake up and be able to speak it would be Japanese.

<p>Favourite sport is Football (or as Aussies call it Soccer) this has be up at all hours of the night to watch EPL games in the UK.
Interested in IT to broaden my current skills base and will be doing all 5 of my elective units in IT. My interest comes from a want to learn how to code to help optimize business processes.

<p> Always have had a keen interest but didnâ€™t have the exposure growing up to develop my skills.

<p>I choose this program to get a start and see if I can get a greater understanding and some extra skills.
<p>I attended a IOT meeting on how the IOT can be used to track waste levels inside bins reducing wasted transport costs and I was hooked in.</p>
